# HalloweenGame
The public repo for our halloween platformer

There's a "naked" solution now. Clone it, Download it, add in your work based on user story assigned, then sync it. For now, just throw it to Master. A few meetings from now we'll have a gitflow model in place- dev, master, and personal repo's.
